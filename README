Welcome to MapBenchmark

This is a simple application to test the performance of different map types
in android. The initial idea was to create an automatic benchmark to test 
native android maps and html maps. Unfortunately measurements in the 
html maps are not trivial to implement, so for now only manual testing is enabled.

For further details see the following questions on StackOverflow:

2. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20482647/measure-complete-time-of-adding-showing-an-array-of-markers-to-google-maps-v3

In this version you can just add only lines and markers to the map.
