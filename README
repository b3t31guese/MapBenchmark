Welcome to MapBenchmark

This is a simple application to test the performance of different map types
in android. The initial idea was to create an automatic benchmark to test 
native android maps and html maps. Unfortunately measurements in the 
html maps are not trivial to implement, so for now manual testing is enabled.

You can add different elements to the map types and manually test their performance
